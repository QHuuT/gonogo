- Click column headers to sort data
- Right-click any table ‚Üí "Show schema" to see table structure
- Use Ctrl+A to select all query text
- Save frequently used queries with "Save SQL file"

### **Option 2: SQLite Command Line**
**Best for**: Automation, scripting, advanced SQL queries

```bash
# Connect to main RTM database
sqlite3 gonogo.db

# Essential SQLite commands (once connected):
.help                                   # Show all SQLite commands
.tables                                 # List all tables
.schema table_name                      # Show table structure
.headers on                            # Show column headers in output
.mode column                           # Format output as aligned columns
.mode csv                              # Format output as CSV
.width 15 30 10                        # Set column widths
.output filename.txt                    # Redirect output to file
.output stdout                         # Reset output to terminal
.quit                                  # Exit SQLite
```

### **Option 3: Project Database Inspector Tool**

ORDER BY pass_rate DESC;
```

## üíæ Data Export and Backup

### **Using DB Browser**
```
1. Right-click results ‚Üí "Export" to save as CSV
2. File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Database to SQL file (complete backup)
3. File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Table to CSV (specific table)
```

### **Using Command Line**
```bash
# Export entire database to SQL dump
sqlite3 gonogo.db .dump > gonogo_backup.sql

# Export specific table to CSV
sqlite3 gonogo.db << EOF
.headers on
.mode csv
.output epics_export.csv
SELECT * FROM epics;
.quit
EOF

# Create database backup
sqlite3 gonogo.db ".backup gonogo_backup.db"

# Import data from SQL dump
sqlite3 new_database.db < gonogo_backup.sql
```

## üîß Database Maintenance

### **Health Checks**
```bash
# Using project tools
python tools/rtm-db.py admin health-check
python tools/rtm-db.py admin validate

# Using SQLite CLI
sqlite3 gonogo.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
sqlite3 gonogo.db "PRAGMA foreign_key_check;"
```

### **Database Statistics**
```sql
-- Database size and page info
PRAGMA page_count;
PRAGMA page_size;
PRAGMA freelist_count;

-- Table row counts
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as row_count
FROM (
    SELECT 'epics' as name UNION ALL SELECT 'user_stories' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'tests' UNION ALL SELECT 'defects' UNION ALL SELECT 'github_sync_records'
) tables
JOIN (
    SELECT 'epics' as name, COUNT(*) as count FROM epics UNION ALL
    SELECT 'user_stories', COUNT(*) FROM user_stories UNION ALL
    SELECT 'tests', COUNT(*) FROM tests UNION ALL
    SELECT 'defects', COUNT(*) FROM defects UNION ALL
    SELECT 'github_sync_records', COUNT(*) FROM github_sync_records
) counts ON tables.name = counts.name;
```

### **Performance Optimization**
```bash
# Optimize database (rebuild indexes, reclaim space)
sqlite3 gonogo.db "VACUUM;"

# Update table statistics
sqlite3 gonogo.db "ANALYZE;"
```

## üéØ Quick Investigation Commands

### **One-Line Queries**
```bash
# Quick epic status check
sqlite3 gonogo.db "SELECT epic_id, status, COUNT(*) FROM epics GROUP BY status;"

# Find failing tests
sqlite3 gonogo.db "SELECT epic_id, test_file, last_execution_status FROM tests WHERE last_execution_status = 'failed';"

# Check recent activity
sqlite3 gonogo.db "SELECT entity_type, COUNT(*) FROM github_sync_records WHERE date(sync_timestamp) = date('now') GROUP BY entity_type;"

# Find high-priority open defects
sqlite3 gonogo.db "SELECT defect_id, title, priority FROM defects WHERE status IN ('open', 'in_progress') AND priority IN ('critical', 'high');"
```

## üìä Test Failure Database Exploration

### **Analyzing Test Failures**
```bash
# Connect to test failures database
sqlite3 quality/logs/test_failures.db

# Common failure analysis queries
.mode column
.headers on

-- Group failures by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as failure_count,
       AVG(occurrence_count) as avg_occurrences
FROM test_failures
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY failure_count DESC;

-- Find flaky tests (frequently failing)
SELECT test_name, test_file, occurrence_count,
       last_seen, category
FROM test_failures
WHERE occurrence_count > 3
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;

-- Recent failure trends
SELECT DATE(last_seen) as failure_date,
       COUNT(*) as failures_that_day
FROM test_failures
WHERE last_seen >= date('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY DATE(last_seen)
ORDER BY failure_date DESC;
```

### **Custom Analysis with Python**
```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to test failures database
conn = sqlite3.connect('quality/logs/test_failures.db')
conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row

# Analyze failure patterns
cursor = conn.execute("""
    SELECT test_name, category, occurrence_count,
           last_seen, error_message
    FROM test_failures
    WHERE occurrence_count > 2
    ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC
""")

for row in cursor:
    print(f"Test: {row['test_name']}")
    print(f"  Category: {row['category']}")
    print(f"  Occurrences: {row['occurrence_count']}")
    print(f"  Last seen: {row['last_seen']}")
    print("---")

conn.close()
```
