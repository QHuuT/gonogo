        ## Epic Creation

        Create an epic to organize related user stories.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The "Epic Description" field below is automatically displayed in the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) reports. Keep it concise and clear for optimal RTM presentation.

    attributes:
      label: Epic Description
      description: |
        üéØ **RTM Integration**: This description appears directly in Requirements Traceability Matrix reports.

        Write a clear, concise description in user story format:
        - Use "As a [user], I want [goal], So that [benefit]" format
        - Add 1-2 sentences explaining the epic's purpose
        - **Limit: 500 characters** (hard limit imposed by RTM import system)
        - Avoid excessive markdown formatting (it will be cleaned for RTM display)
        - Focus on the essential user story and business purpose

        ## üìä Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) Integration

        **Fields displayed in RTM reports:**
        - ‚úÖ **Epic Description** ‚Üí Main display (500 char limit) - keep concise!
        - ‚úÖ **Component** ‚Üí System component classification for organization
        - ‚úÖ **Epic Status** ‚Üí Progress tracking
        - ‚úÖ **GitHub Links** ‚Üí Direct links to this issue
        - ‚úÖ **User Story Progress** ‚Üí Calculated automatically

        **Fields NOT displayed in RTM (for detailed documentation):**

        - üìù **Business Value** ‚Üí Internal stakeholder reference
        - üìù **Success Criteria** ‚Üí Detailed acceptance criteria
        - üìù **Risks & Dependencies** ‚Üí Project management details

        **After creating this epic:**
        1. Link related User Stories using "Parent Epic: EP-XXXXX" in their descriptions
        2. Epic progress will be automatically calculated in RTM reports
        3. View RTM reports: `python tools/dynamic_rtm_demo.py --html`

        **Component Inheritance System:**
        - **Epic Components**: Automatically populated based on child User Stories
        - **Unique Components**: Each component appears only once, even if multiple User Stories use it
        - **Dynamic Updates**: Components update automatically as User Stories are added/modified
        - **Manual Override**: Components can be manually selected during epic creation if needed

        **Component Types**:
        - **Frontend/UI**: User interface, web components, styling, templates
        - **Backend/API**: Server logic, API endpoints, business rules, services
        - **Database**: Schema changes, migrations, data models, queries
        - **Security/GDPR**: Authentication, authorization, privacy compliance
        - **Testing**: Test infrastructure, quality assurance tools, test automation
        - **CI/CD**: Build pipelines, deployment automation, GitHub Actions
        - **Documentation**: User guides, technical docs, API documentation

        üí° **Best Practice**: Use Epic Description for RTM (concise), Detailed Description for comprehensive documentation!
