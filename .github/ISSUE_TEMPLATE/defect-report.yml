        ## üîó Linking Defects to Requirements

        **When to link to User Story**:
        - Defect found in implemented user story functionality
        - Bug prevents user story acceptance criteria from being met
        - Regression in previously working user story

        **When to link to Epic**:
        - Defect affects multiple user stories within an epic
        - Epic-level architectural or design issue
        - No specific user story exists yet

        **Format Examples**:
        - User Story: "US-00042" or "#42"
        - Epic: "EP-00005"

        **Component Inheritance**: If a related User Story or Epic is specified, this defect will automatically inherit the component from that parent requirement.
