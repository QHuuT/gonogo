        ## Next Steps

        1. Story will be reviewed and refined during backlog grooming
        2. BDD scenarios will be created in technical documentation
        3. Story will be added to the Requirements Traceability Matrix
        4. Implementation will follow the [BDD + RTM Development Workflow](../CLAUDE.md#bdd--rtm-development-workflow)

        **Traceability** - This story will be automatically linked to the parent epic and tracked in the RTM.
