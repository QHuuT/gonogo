"""
Unit tests for RTM JavaScript filter functionality.

Tests the RTM filtering JavaScript functions using mock HTML structures
to ensure filters work correctly after the fix.

Features tested:
- User Story filtering by status
- Test filtering by type
- Defect filtering by priority/status
- Filter button state management
- CSS selector correctness
