# EP-004: GitHub Workflow Integration

**Epic ID**: EP-004
**Epic Name**: GitHub Workflow Integration
**Priority**: High
**Business Value**: Streamlines project management by integrating documentation with GitHub issues, reducing duplication and improving collaboration

## Epic Description
**As a** development team (solo or collaborative)
**We want** to integrate our BDD + RTM workflow with GitHub Issues and Projects
**So that** we can manage epics, user stories, and defects directly in GitHub while maintaining traceability

## Success Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Issues automatically created from epic/user story templates
- [ ] Bi-directional sync between repository documentation and GitHub Issues
- [ ] Traceability matrix viewable as GitHub Pages website
- [ ] GitHub Projects board reflects current epic/story status
- [ ] Labels and milestones align with epic priorities and releases

## Business Outcomes
- **Primary**: Unified project management in GitHub (no external tools needed)
- **Primary**: Automatic traceability matrix updates from GitHub activity
- **Secondary**: Public documentation site for stakeholder visibility
- **Secondary**: Improved collaboration through GitHub's native tools
- **Metrics**:
  - 100% epics, user stories, and defects tracked in GitHub Issues
  - RTM automatically updated within 24h of GitHub changes
  - Zero manual synchronization between docs and GitHub

## User Stories in Epic
- US-009: GitHub Issue Template Integration
- US-010: Automated Traceability Matrix Updates
- US-011: GitHub Pages Documentation Site
- US-012: GitHub Projects Board Configuration

## Dependencies
- Existing BDD + RTM documentation structure (EP-001, EP-002, EP-003)
- GitHub repository with Issues and Projects enabled
- GitHub Actions for automation

## Risks
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Risk Description**: Information duplication between repository and GitHub Issues
- **Mitigation**:
  - Make GitHub Issues the single source of truth for status
  - Keep detailed technical specs in repository
  - Use automation to sync rather than manual updates
  - Clear separation: GitHub for management, repo for implementation details

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level)
- [ ] All user stories in epic completed
- [ ] GitHub Issue templates functional for epics/stories/defects
- [ ] Traceability matrix automatically updates from GitHub
- [ ] GitHub Pages site displays current documentation
- [ ] Projects board reflects accurate epic/story status
- [ ] Labels and milestones properly configured
- [ ] Automation workflows tested and reliable

## Technical Considerations
### Architecture Implications
- **Single Source of Truth**: GitHub Issues for status, repo for technical details
- **Automation Layer**: GitHub Actions for sync and updates
- **Documentation Flow**: Repo â†’ GitHub Pages for public visibility

### Technology Choices
- **GitHub Issues**: Project management and tracking
- **GitHub Actions**: Automation and CI/CD integration
- **GitHub Pages**: Public documentation hosting
- **GitHub Projects**: Kanban board for visual management

### Integration Points
- **Issue Templates**: Custom templates for epic/story/defect creation
- **Label Strategy**: Priority, epic, component, status labels
- **Milestone Mapping**: Releases aligned with MVP/iteration planning

## Definition of Done (Epic Level)
- [ ] All user stories meet their individual DoD
- [ ] GitHub workflow fully integrated and tested
- [ ] Team can create and manage issues without manual RTM updates
- [ ] Documentation automatically publishes to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Projects board accurately reflects current work
- [ ] Issue templates validated by creating test epic/story/defect
- [ ] Rollback plan: can revert to manual documentation if needed

## Implementation Strategy
### Phase 1: Foundation (US-009)
- Create GitHub Issue templates
- Set up basic labels and milestones
- Test manual issue creation

### Phase 2: Automation (US-010)
- Build GitHub Actions for RTM updates
- Implement bi-directional sync
- Add automated status tracking

### Phase 3: Visibility (US-011)
- Deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
- Configure public access and navigation
- Test stakeholder access

### Phase 4: Management (US-012)
- Set up GitHub Projects board
- Configure automation rules
- Train team on new workflow
