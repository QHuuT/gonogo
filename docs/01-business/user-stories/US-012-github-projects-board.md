**Epic**: [EP-004: GitHub Workflow Integration](../epics/EP-004-github-workflow-integration.md)
**Story ID**: US-012
**Priority**: Medium
**Complexity**: 3 Story Points

## User Story
**As a** project manager or team member
**I want** a GitHub Projects board that shows epic and user story progress
**So that** I can visualize work status and manage project workflow

## Business Value
- Provides visual project management interface
- Integrates seamlessly with GitHub Issues workflow
- Enables agile project management without external tools
- Supports both solo and team development workflows

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** I access the GitHub Projects board, **When** I view it, **Then** I see columns for Backlog, In Progress, Testing, Done
- [ ] **Given** an epic or user story changes status, **When** updated, **Then** it moves to appropriate column automatically
- [ ] **Given** I want to see epic grouping, **When** I view board, **Then** user stories are grouped under their parent epics
- [ ] **Given** I want to filter work, **When** I use filters, **Then** I can view by epic, priority, or assignee
- [ ] **Given** I drag an issue between columns, **When** moved, **Then** GitHub Issue status updates automatically

### Non-Functional Requirements
