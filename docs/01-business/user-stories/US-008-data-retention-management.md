# US-008: Data Retention Management

**Epic**: [EP-003: Privacy and Consent Management](../epics/EP-003-privacy-and-consent-management.md)
**Story ID**: US-008
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: 8 Story Points

## User Story
**As a** data protection officer
**I want** personal data to be automatically removed after retention periods
**So that** we comply with GDPR data minimization principles

## Business Value
- Automatic GDPR compliance for data retention
- Reduces privacy risk exposure
- Demonstrates privacy by design

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** comment data is 3 years old, **When** retention job runs, **Then** personal data is anonymized
- [ ] **Given** consent is withdrawn, **When** processing, **Then** associated data is removed within 30 days
- [ ] **Given** IP addresses are 30 days old, **When** cleanup runs, **Then** IPs are anonymized
- [ ] **Given** data retention occurs, **When** completed, **Then** audit logs are created

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Automation**: Runs automatically without manual intervention
- [ ] **Reliability**: 99.9% successful execution rate
