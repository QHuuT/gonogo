# US-010: Automated Traceability Matrix Updates

**Epic**: [EP-004: GitHub Workflow Integration](../epics/EP-004-github-workflow-integration.md)
**Story ID**: US-010
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: 8 Story Points

## User Story
**As a** project manager or developer
**I want** the requirements traceability matrix to automatically update when GitHub Issues change
**So that** I have real-time visibility into project status without manual maintenance

## Business Value
- Eliminates manual RTM maintenance overhead
- Provides real-time project status visibility
- Ensures traceability accuracy through automation
- Enables data-driven project decisions

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** a GitHub Issue is created from template, **When** it's processed, **Then** RTM automatically adds new entry
- [ ] **Given** a GitHub Issue status changes, **When** the change occurs, **Then** RTM status column updates within 1 hour
- [ ] **Given** an Issue is closed, **When** it's marked complete, **Then** RTM shows "✅ Done" status
- [ ] **Given** an Issue links to another (epic to story), **When** created, **Then** RTM shows proper hierarchy
- [ ] **Given** a defect is linked to a user story, **When** linked, **Then** RTM defects column updates
- [ ] **Given** RTM is updated, **When** changes are made, **Then** updated file is committed to repository

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Performance**: Updates complete within 1 hour of GitHub changes
- [ ] **Reliability**: 99% successful automation rate
- [ ] **Auditability**: All automated changes logged and traceable
- [ ] **Rollback**: Manual override capability for incorrect automation

## GDPR Considerations
### Data Processing
- **Personal Data Involved**: GitHub usernames in commit logs
- **Legal Basis**: Legitimate interest (project management)
- **Retention Period**: As per git history (indefinite)
- **Data Subject Rights**: N/A (public development activity)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow created for RTM updates
- [ ] Webhook or event-driven updates working
- [ ] All issue state changes reflected in RTM
- [ ] Epic-to-story hierarchy maintained automatically
- [ ] Defect linking functional
- [ ] Error handling and logging implemented
- [ ] Manual override mechanism working
- [ ] Integration tested with all issue types
- [ ] Documentation updated with automation details
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for automation failures

## Dependencies
- [ ] US-009: GitHub Issue templates must be functional
- [ ] GitHub Actions enabled for repository
- [ ] GitHub API access and permissions configured
- [ ] RTM format standardized for automation parsing

## Technical Notes
### Implementation Approach
- Use GitHub Actions triggered by issue events
- Parse issue templates to extract RTM data
- Update RTM file using git operations
- Implement error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Add logging for audit trail

### Automation Events
- Issue opened/closed/edited
- Issue labeled/unlabeled
- Issue assigned/unassigned
- Issue milestone changes
- Cross-references added/removed

### Data Mapping
- Issue state → RTM Status column
- Issue labels → RTM Priority/Type
- Issue milestone → RTM Release
- Issue relationships → RTM Hierarchy

## Story Estimation
**Story Points**: 8
**Confidence Level**: Medium (depends on GitHub API complexity)
