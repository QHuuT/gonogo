# Business Requirements - MOVED TO GITHUB ISSUES

**⚠️ This directory is being phased out in favor of GitHub-first project management.**

## 🔄 Where to Find Business Requirements Now

### Active Project Management (Primary)
- **📋 Create Epics/Stories**: [GitHub Issue Templates](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)
- **📊 Track Progress**: [GitHub Issues](../../../issues)
- **🎯 Current Work**: [Active Issues](../../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

### Documentation (Secondary)
- **🔗 Requirements Matrix**: [RTM Web Dashboard](http://localhost:8000/api/rtm/reports/matrix?format=html)
- **📚 GitHub Workflow**: [How to Use GitHub Issues](../../.github/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md)

## 🚀 Quick Migration Guide

### Instead of Creating Files Here:
- ❌ ~~Copy templates and create .md files~~
- ✅ **Use [GitHub Issue Templates](../../../issues/new/choose)**

### Instead of Manual Tracking:
- ❌ ~~Update README tables manually~~
- ✅ **Check [GitHub Issues](../../../issues) for live status**

### Instead of Static Documentation:
- ❌ ~~Maintain separate epic/story files~~
- ✅ **GitHub Issues provide discussion, status, and history**

## 📋 Current Epic Status (Will be in GitHub Issues)

- **EP-001**: Blog Content Management (8 pts) → [Create Epic Issue](../../../issues/new?template=epic.yml)
- **EP-002**: GDPR-Compliant Comment System (16 pts) → [Create Epic Issue](../../../issues/new?template=epic.yml)
- **EP-003**: Privacy and Consent Management (29 pts) → [Create Epic Issue](../../../issues/new?template=epic.yml)
- **EP-004**: GitHub Workflow Integration (21 pts) ✅ Templates Complete

## 🗂️ This Directory Will Be Cleaned Up

This directory contains legacy documentation files that are being replaced by GitHub Issues:
- `epics/` folder → Moving to GitHub Epic Issues
- `user-stories/` folder → Moving to GitHub Story Issues
- `defects/` folder → Moving to GitHub Defect Issues
- Templates → Already moved to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

## 🔗 Next Steps

1. **Visit [GitHub Issues](../../../issues/new/choose)** to create your first epic
2. **Review [GitHub Workflow Guide](../../.github/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md)** for complete usage
3. **Check [RTM Web Dashboard](http://localhost:8000/api/rtm/reports/matrix?format=html)** for current traceability (start server first)

**🎯 Goal**: Transition fully to GitHub Issues for all active project management while keeping `docs/` for technical reference.
