   - Get issue details (title, body, state, labels, assignees)
   - Fetch issue comments for additional context
   - Retrieve issue history for audit trail

2. **Webhook Event Processing**
   - Issue created, updated, closed events
   - Comment added, edited events
   - Label and assignee change events

3. **Search and Filtering**
   - Find issues by Epic reference
   - Filter by labels and milestones
   - Search issue content for entity references

#### API Rate Limiting Considerations
- **GitHub Apps**: 5,000 requests/hour per installation
- **Personal Access Tokens**: 5,000 requests/hour per user
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache issue metadata to minimize API calls
- **Batch Processing**: Group API requests to maximize efficiency

## 3. Database Integration Requirements

### 3.1 Epic Management in Database

#### Epic Creation and Lifecycle
- **Creation Source**: Direct database entry (no GitHub issue needed)
- **Identification**: EP-XXXXX format with auto-incrementing numbers
- **Progress Tracking**: Calculated from linked GitHub US issues
- **Status Management**: Independent of GitHub, based on completion criteria

#### Epic-to-US Relationship Mapping
```sql
-- Epic stored in database
CREATE TABLE epics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    epic_id VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- EP-00001 format
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    completion_percentage FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0
);

-- US metadata cached from GitHub
CREATE TABLE user_stories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_story_id VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- US-00001 format
    epic_id INTEGER REFERENCES epics(id),
    github_issue_number INTEGER UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    github_issue_state VARCHAR(20),
    story_points INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

### 3.2 Test Discovery and Tracking

#### Test Entity Management
- **Discovery**: Automated scanning of test files in repository
- **Classification**: Unit, integration, BDD, security, e2e test types
- **Linking**: Associate tests with Epics and GitHub US/DEF references
- **Execution Tracking**: Store test results, duration, failure patterns

#### BDD Scenario Integration
```python
# Test linking via code annotations
@pytest.mark.epic("EP-00001")
@pytest.mark.user_story("US-00012")
@pytest.mark.defect("DEF-00003")
def test_authentication_flow():
    """Test user authentication with GDPR compliance."""
    pass
```

### 3.3 Traceability Chain Implementation

#### Full Traceability Path
```
Epic (Database)
    ↓ references
User Story (GitHub Issue)
    ↓ tested by
Test (Database)
    ↓ finds bugs in
Defect (GitHub Issue)
    ↓ relates back to
Epic (Database)
```

#### Cross-Reference Resolution
1. **Epic → US**: Query database for epic_id, fetch linked GitHub issues
2. **US → Tests**: Parse test annotations for user_story references
3. **Test → Defects**: Track defect_id references in test failure logs
4. **Defect → Epic**: Parse Epic references in defect issue body

## 4. Synchronization Strategy Design

### 4.1 Data Flow Architecture

#### Unidirectional Sync: GitHub → Database
```
GitHub Issues (Source of Truth)
    ↓ webhook events
GitHub Actions (Event Processing)
    ↓ API calls
Database RTM (Cached Metadata)
    ↓ queries
Reports & Dashboards (Visualization)
```

#### Metadata Synchronization
- **User Stories**: Sync title, state, assignees, labels, story points
- **Defects**: Sync title, state, priority, severity, resolution status
- **Epic References**: Parse and update Epic-to-US relationships
- **Test Associations**: Update test-to-issue links based on annotations

### 4.2 Real-time vs Batch Processing

#### Real-time Sync (Webhooks)
- **Use Cases**: Critical state changes (issue closed, priority changed)
- **Events**: Issue created, updated, closed, labeled
- **Latency**: < 30 seconds from GitHub event to database update
- **Benefits**: Immediate dashboard updates, real-time progress tracking

#### Batch Processing (Scheduled)
- **Use Cases**: Full data consistency checks, bulk metadata updates
- **Schedule**: Every 6 hours for consistency validation
- **Operations**: Full issue scan, orphaned record cleanup, data validation
- **Benefits**: Catches missed webhook events, ensures data integrity

### 4.3 Conflict Resolution Strategy

#### Data Consistency Rules
1. **GitHub is Source of Truth**: For US/DEF title, description, status
2. **Database is Source of Truth**: For Epic progress, test execution results
3. **Derived Data**: Epic completion calculated from GitHub US status
4. **Conflict Detection**: Compare last_modified timestamps

#### Conflict Resolution Process
```python
def resolve_sync_conflict(github_data, database_data):
    """Resolve conflicts between GitHub and database."""
    if github_data['updated_at'] > database_data['last_sync_time']:
        # GitHub is newer, update database
        return update_database_from_github(github_data)
    elif has_database_changes(database_data):
        # Database has local changes, flag for manual review
        return flag_for_manual_resolution(github_data, database_data)
    else:
        # No conflict, data is in sync
        return mark_as_synchronized()
```

### 4.4 Error Handling and Recovery

#### GitHub API Failure Handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Network Errors**: Retry with circuit breaker pattern
- **Authentication Failures**: Alert administrators, use backup tokens
- **Data Validation**: Reject malformed webhook payloads

#### Database Transaction Safety
- **Atomic Updates**: All related data updated in single transaction
- **Rollback on Failure**: Revert partial updates if sync fails
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Consistent lock ordering for concurrent updates
- **Data Validation**: Check referential integrity before commit
