# Cross-Cutting Architecture Documentation

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-20

## 🎯 Overview

This documentation covers architectural decisions and patterns that span across multiple technical capabilities. These cross-cutting concerns provide the foundation for the entire GoNoGo platform.

## 📁 Documentation Structure

- [**System Architecture**](system-architecture.md) - Overall system design and component relationships
- [**Shared Infrastructure**](shared-infrastructure.md) - Common infrastructure components and patterns
- [**Security Architecture**](security-architecture.md) - Security patterns and compliance frameworks
- [**Integration Patterns**](integration-patterns.md) - Inter-component communication and data flow

## 🏗️ Architectural Principles

### 1. Privacy-by-Design
All components implement privacy protection as a foundational principle, not an afterthought.

### 2. GDPR Compliance
Built-in compliance with European data protection regulations across all capabilities.

### 3. GitHub-First Development
Unified development workflow using GitHub's native tools for project management and automation.

### 4. Performance-Oriented
Optimized for fast response times and efficient resource utilization.

## 🔗 Cross-Cutting Relationships

### Component Dependencies
